# Perovskite Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Study

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of **Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)** for the poster used in Poster compition organized by Amity School of Engineering Technology, including code for simulating their efficiency, stability, environmental impact, refrences, sources and Acknowledgement. Perovskite solar cells are a promising technology for renewable energy, thanks to their high efficiency and low-cost production. This repository aims to explore their potential, challenges, and advantages through code, data analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- **Simulation of Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency** under various environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- **Optimization Algorithms** for maximizing power conversion efficiency.
- **Environmental and Economic Analysis** for understanding the feasibility of PSCs in comparison to silicon solar cells.
- **Data Visualizations**: Generate plots and charts to visualize efficiency trends, stability data, and environmental impact.

## Source Codes

These are some demo code which you can personalize and run that will give you the estimates and visual representation of the codes generated to us. Feel free to edit the code and make it personalize and change the demo data for demonstration or calculation part.
