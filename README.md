# Perovskite Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Study

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of **Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)**, including code for simulating their efficiency, stability, and environmental impact. Perovskite solar cells are a promising technology for renewable energy, thanks to their high efficiency and low-cost production. This repository aims to explore their potential, challenges, and advantages through code, data analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- **Simulation of Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency** under various environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- **Optimization Algorithms** for maximizing power conversion efficiency.
- **Environmental and Economic Analysis** for understanding the feasibility of PSCs in comparison to silicon solar cells.
- **Data Visualizations**: Generate plots and charts to visualize efficiency trends, stability data, and environmental impact.
