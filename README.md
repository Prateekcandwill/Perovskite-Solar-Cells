# Perovskite Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Study

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of **Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)** for the poster used in Poster compition organized by Amity School of Engineering Technology, including code for simulating their efficiency, stability, environmental impact, refrences, sources and Acknowledgement. Perovskite solar cells are a promising technology for renewable energy, thanks to their high efficiency and low-cost production. This repository aims to explore their potential, challenges, and advantages through code, data analysis, and visualization.
